=head1 mimedecode.pl

This script opens all files given as parameters on the command line
and destructively converts them to binary files.

Something similar could be achieved using command line tools.
Unfortunately, they are not always available. If Perl's MIME library
is available instead, you can use this script.

=cut

use MIME::Base64;

local $/;
while (<>) {
  close ARGV;
  if (substr($_,0,6) eq '#FILE ') {
    print "$ARGV\n";
    s/^.*\n//;
    my $bytes = decode_base64($_);
    open(F, "> $ARGV");
    print F $bytes;
    close F;
  }
}
