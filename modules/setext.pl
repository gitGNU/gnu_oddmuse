# foo
# ===

# It ignores the amount of whitespace after the title and the
# underlining, and it allows underlining using ==== or ----.  The
# underlining has to be exactly as wide as the title itself.  If it is
# too long or too short, the entire thing is not a title.
#
# If the length does not match, pos is reset and zero is returned so
# that the remaining rules will be tested instead.
