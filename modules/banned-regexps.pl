=h1 Compatibility

This extension works with logbannedcontent.pl.

=h1 Example content for the BannedRegexps page:

    # This page lists regular expressions that prevent the saving of a page.
    # The regexps are matched against any page or comment submitted.
    # The format is simple: # comments to the end of the line. Empty lines are ignored.
    # Everything else is a regular expression. If the regular expression is followed by
    # a comment, this is used as the explanation when a user is denied editing. If the
    # comment starts with a date, this date is not included in the explanation.
    # The date could help us decide which regular expressions to delete in the future.
    # In other words:
    # ^\s*([^#]+?)\s*(#\s*(\d\d\d\d-\d\d-\d\d\s*)?(.*))?$
    # Group 1 is the regular expression to use.
    # Group 4 is the explanation to use.
