=head1 Put Extension

This module allows you to upload wiki pages using the PUT request
method. For example:

    echo test | curl -T - http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/test/Mu

This will replace the Mu page with "test".

Note that you cannot use an URL that will be rewritten by Apache
mod_rewrite as the target for your PUT request. Apparently mod_rewrite
only works reliably for GET requests.

  if ($q->request_method() eq 'PUT') {
    my $data;
    while (<STDIN>) {
      $data .= $_;
      # protect against denial of service attacks?
      if (length($data) > $MaxPost) {
        ReportError(T('Upload is limited to %s bytes', $MaxPost),
                    '413 REQUEST ENTITY TOO LARGE');

    SetParam('text', $data);
