# Makes the wiki logo depend on the current date.
#
# Example Usage: Put the following into your config file and modify as
# needed:
#
#  $DynLogoDirectory = '/mypic/dynlogo';
#  $DynLogoDefault = 'wiki.jpg';
#  %DynLogoMap = ('\d{4}-12-31' => 'party.jpg');
#  $LogoUrl = GetDynLogoUrl();
#

# This maps a regular expression matching a date string of the form
# "%Y-%m-%d" to a filename in the $DynLogoDirectory. Example usage:
# %DynLogoMap = ('\d{4}-12-24'=>'logo-1224.jpg');
