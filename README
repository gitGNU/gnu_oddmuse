This is the README file distributed together with the
<nowiki>OddMuse</nowiki> script.

You will see this text when you install the script as long as the
homepage (the first link on the navigation bar, just below the title)
has no text.

In order to start your wiki, click on the edit link (the first link
below the navigation bar, at the end of this page).  This will allow
you to enter some text for this page.  Click the Save button and you
are done.

To add new pages, edit the homepage and add links to new pages.  Links
are traditionally formed by
<nowiki>ConcatenatingCapitalizedWords</nowiki>.  This kind of link
pattern is called a wiki word.  Alternatively, put links in
<nowiki>[[double square brackets]]</nowiki>.  This kind of link
pattern is called a free link.

As long as the new pages don't exist, links to these pages are
followed by a clickable question mark.  Click on the question mark to
create the new page.

Suggested starting places:

* SandBox -- this is the traditional name for the page where visitors
  can experiment.

Enjoy your wiki experience.
