To install the script, you need to put it into your cgi-bin directory
and allow your web-server to execute it.  How this is done, and where
your cgi-bin directory is, depends on your setup.

== Apache 1.3 on a Debian GNU/Linux system ==

Copy the script wiki.pl into a directory of your choice.  In this
example I will assume /home/alex/src/oddmuse/.

Make it executable for everybody:

    chmod +x wiki.pl

Make sure CGI scripts can be executed in this directory.  In
/etc/apache/access.conf, add a directory as follows.  The only
important option is the ExecCGI option.

    <Directory /home/alex/src/oddmuse>
    AllowOverride None
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    </Directory>

Now make sure that this directory is reachable by the web server.
Make sure the /etc/apache/srm.conf file has a line similar to the
following:

    ScriptAlias /my-cgi-bin/ /home/alex/src/oddmuse/

This will make the CGI directory registered in access.conf accessible
via the URL path /my-cgi-bin/.

Restart the server.  As root, run:

    /etc/init.d/apache restart

Try it by visiting the following URL:

    http://localhost/my-cgi-bin/wiki.pl
