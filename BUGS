I've seen a bug that shows as follows:  <strong class="changes">think
it belongs anymore.</stron><strong class="changes">g>.

Is DiffHtmlMarkWords called twice for a chunk?

It seems that following the diff link from RC to a page that has
a minor edit at the end will show a minor diff instead of a major
diff, eventhough it *says* that it will show a major diff!
