Usage: perl server.pl [WIKI [PORT [DIR]]]

Example: perl server.pl wiki.pl 8080 ~/src/oddmuse/test-data

You may provide the Oddmuse wiki script on the command line. If you do not
provide it, WIKI will default to 'wiki.pl'.

You may provide a port number on the command line. If you do not provide it,
PORT will default to 8080.

You may provide a data directory on the command line. It will be used to set the
environment variable 'WikiDataDir'. If it is not not set, Oddmuse will default
to '/tmp/oddmuse'.

A simple test setup would be the following shell script:

#/bin/sh
if test -z "$WikiDataDir"; then
    export WikiDataDir=/tmp/oddmuse
fi
mkdir -p "$WikiDataDir"
echo <<EOF > "$WikiDataDir/config"
$AdminPass = 'foo';
$ScriptName = 'http://localhost/';
EOF
perl stuff/server.pl wiki.pl &
SERVER=$!
sleep 1
w3m http://localhost:8080/
kill $!

This will run the server exactly once, allow you to browse the site using w3m,
and when you're done, it'll kill the server for you.

EOT

my $server = Oddmuse::Server->new($port);

# $server->background();
$server->run();
