Code for Special Circumstances
==============================

The files in this directory serve a particular purpose which might be
of interest to others. These are not generic scripts (there is a
separate directory for those). These are CGI scripts that post to a
Campaign Wiki, that allow you to edit wikis using Emacs, that copy
data from a particular site and post them to the Emacs Wiki.
