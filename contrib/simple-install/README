This is the README file distributed as part of the simple-install
package together with the Oddmuse script.

Unzip all the files into a directory served by Apache. Get the
current.pl file from here: http://emacswiki.org/scripts/current.pl

Your directory should now contain the following files:

* README (this file)
* .htaccess (information for Apache)
* config (a simple config file for you to modify)
* wiki.pl (a wrapper script setting the data directory)
* current.pl (the main script)
* modules (a directory containing modules)
* modules/creole.pl (support for the standard wiki markup)

The wiki pages will be saved in this directory.

Make sure the www user (or whoever Apache runs under) has write access
to this directory. In that directory, try chmod o+w . and see if that
helps when you get an error message saying that Oddmuse cannot create
the temp directory.

You need to make sure that your administrator has allowed
AllowOverride All in his httpd.conf file for the settings in the
.htaccess file provided to have an effect.

Running Oddmuse will create more files, eventually.

* pages (the directory containing the pages)
* keep (the directory containing older versions of pages)
* pageidx (a file containing the names of existing pages)
* rc.log (the file used to produce RecentChanges)
* visitors.log (the file used to log the most recent visitors)
* temp (a temporary directory for log files and the like)

In order to start your wiki, click on the edit link (the first link
below the navigation bar, at the bottom of the page).  This will allow
you to enter some text for this page.  Click the Save button and you
are done.

To add new pages, edit the homepage and add links to new pages.  Links
are traditionally formed by ConcatenatingCapitalizedWords.  This kind
of link pattern is called a wiki word.

Alternatively, put links in [[double square brackets]].  This kind of
link pattern is called a free link.

As long as the new pages don't exist, links to these pages are
followed by a clickable question mark.  Click on the question mark to
create the new page.

Enjoy your wiki experience.
